Opinionated Git spun from a great discussion with [Edward Thomson](https://twitter.com/ethomson) on [All Things Git](https://allthingsgit.com).

The Git community at large has a tendency to say "it depends", we can't agree on
many things, exactly because there are many right ways to do everything.

This can be very scary for a new Git users as it can be hard to get an
unambigious answer when scraping the web for solutions.

This is a very opinionated website - take it as such :)
