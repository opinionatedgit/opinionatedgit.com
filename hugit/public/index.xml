      <description>Opinionated Git spun from a great discussion with Edward Thomson on All Things Git.
The Git community at large has a tendency to say &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;, we can&amp;rsquo;t agree on many things, exactly because there are many right ways to do everything.
This can be very scary for a new Git user as it can be hard to get an unambigious answer when scraping the web for solutions.
This is a very opinionated website - take it as such :)</description>

      <description>Opinionated Git Should I rebase or merge A very common question is &amp;ldquo;Should I merge or should I rebase?&amp;rdquo;. Always do rebases. It makes your history look prettier.
For a more in-depth look at the difference between the two approaches please read merge vs. rebase by Edward Thomson.
Should I use submodules for dependencies No, use a proper dependency management tool!
Also note that subtree and subrepo should be avoided.</description>
